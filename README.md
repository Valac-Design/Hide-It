Hide It! is focused on the usability of obsidian, allowing users to completely hide the tabs from their UI and in future versions will add more optional settings regarding buttons that hide currently.

How to use:
In Obsidian, open settings, plugins and make sure community plugins are enabled, then place the plugin in the folder of the same name within their obsidian install and enable it with the slider in the settings menu.
